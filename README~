Pocket-Match(version2.0) README file:
Deepesh Nagarajan, 2011, NSC lab. 

These programs/scripts generate all-to-all Pocket-Match(PM) pocket-comparison scores for given pocket-descriptor input-files (cabbage format). 

The end-user workflow is as follows: 

1) enter the 'Pocketmatch_v2.0' directory on terminal: 
    
    $ cd PocketMatch_v2.0 

2) Create 'alpha-files'. A sampling of PDB-format pockets is provided in the 'Sample_pockets' folder: 

    $ cd alpha-file_maker 
    $ bash Step0-cabbage.sh Sample_pockets 

to explore other options, simply type: 
    
    $ bash Step0-cabbage.sh 

3) Run pocketmatch of generated alpha_file (outfile.cabbage) 

    $ cd ../ 
    $ ./Step3-PM_serial alpha-file_maker/outfile.cabbage 

4) interpret output: 

    $ cat PocketMatch_score.txt            #this file contains the similarity score.
    $ cat PocketMatch_pairs.txt|fold -64   #this file contains pairings of similar residues. 

5) Altering the code: If you are unsatisfied with the speed of Pocketmatch (./Step3-PM_serial), then you can turn off the 'sphinx module' (it generates the 'PocketMatch_pairs.txt' file). This is how you can do it: 
    
    $ #TURN OFF SPHINX MODULE 
    $ sed -i s/"#define SUMA_TOGGLE 1"/"#define SUMA_TOGGLE 0"/ Step3-PM_serial.c 
    $ gcc4.4 -o Step3-PMserial Step3-PMserial.c -lm -m32 

    $ #TURN ON SPHINX MODULE 
    $ sed -i s/"#define SUMA_TOGGLE 0"/"#define SUMA_TOGGLE 1"/ Step3-PM_serial.c 
    $ gcc4.4 -o Step3-PMserial Step3-PMserial.c -lm -m32

If you still have unresolved issues, e-mail me at 1337deepesh@gmail.com 
I may or may not reply. 

UPDATE (Tuesday 12 May 2015 05:55:36 PM IST): 
All programs were written on a 32-bit machine. If you're using a 64-bit maching and want to re-compile any programs, then use these commands: 
    
   $ gcc4.4 -o Step2-compressor Step2-compressor.c 
   $ gcc4.4 -o Step3-PMserial Step3-PMserial.c -lm -m32 

NOTE:
The MPI version has not been tested on 64-bit operating systems and is NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK. I strongly recommend using the serial version on multiple processors instead.
